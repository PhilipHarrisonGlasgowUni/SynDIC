# synDIC
The idea behind these codes is to evaluate the viability of tracking strains across historic tapestries using DIC, when using the tapestry image (rather than a speckle-pattern) to track displacements. 

To do this we synthetically deform images using FE-generated strain fields (based on the images-features), then use these deformed-images to assess the accuracy of DIC measurements in tracking displacements and strains, by comparing the latter with the FEA predicted displacements and strains.
